## Describe my `Ionic Seed` Project


## Describe the motivation of using Gulp in my project

I wanted to create a definitive set of reusable tasks,

using a package structure.

for:

– Test my JS code for errors

– Test my JS code for style

– Distribute files to either a Development or Production folder

– Concatenate and minify files for distribution

– Create a set of `template` html files which can be cached

– Build CSS files from a SASS source

– Convert local URLs to CDN ones and provide fallbacks

– Perform various Cordova/Ionic operations

– Serve the files to a local server

– Add a watch to rebuild on the fly

– Add tasks for git utilities

– A task to increment version numbers
